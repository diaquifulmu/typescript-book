Daddy Telugu Movie Review: A Sentimental Saga of a Father's Love
 
Daddy is a film that showcases the emotional bond between a father and his daughter, and how he overcomes various obstacles to protect her. The film is a remake of the Tamil film Poove Unakkaga, which was also remade in Hindi as Badhaai Ho Badhaai. The film features Chiranjeevi in a dual role of a father and a son, and Simran as his wife. Ashima Bhalla plays the role of his daughter, who is actually the daughter of his friend Rajendra Prasad.
 
The film has a simple plot, but it is filled with many twists and turns that keep the audience engaged. The film has a good mix of comedy, drama, romance and action. The film also has some melodious songs composed by S. A. Rajkumar, which add to the mood of the film. The film also has some impressive dance sequences by Chiranjeevi and Allu Arjun, who makes a cameo appearance as his student.
 
The film's strength lies in its performances, especially by Chiranjeevi, who delivers a powerful and versatile performance as both the father and the son. He portrays the emotions of love, anger, guilt, pain and joy with ease and conviction. He also shows his charisma and style in the dance numbers. Simran is also good as his wife, who supports him through thick and thin. Ashima Bhalla is cute and innocent as his daughter, who loves him unconditionally. Rajendra Prasad is also effective as his friend, who sacrifices his love for him.

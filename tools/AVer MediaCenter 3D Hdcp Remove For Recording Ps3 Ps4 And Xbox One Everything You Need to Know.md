# How to Record HDCP Content with AVer MediaCenter 3D and a Splitter
 
HDCP stands for High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection, and it is a form of copy protection that prevents unauthorized copying of digital video and audio content. HDCP is enabled by default on devices like PS3, PS4 and Xbox One, which means that you cannot record or stream their output with a capture card like AVer MediaCenter 3D unless you disable HDCP or bypass it with a splitter.

A splitter is a device that splits one HDMI signal into two or more outputs, and some splitters can also strip off the HDCP encryption from the signal. This allows you to connect one output to your TV or monitor, and another output to your capture card without any HDCP issues. However, not all splitters can do this, so you need to find one that is compatible with your devices and supports the resolution and refresh rate that you want to record.
 
One example of a splitter that can remove HDCP is the ViewHD 2 Port 1x2 Powered HDMI Mini Splitter[^1^], which costs around $20 and supports up to 1080p at 60Hz. To use this splitter, you need to connect your PS3, PS4 or Xbox One to the input port of the splitter with an HDMI cable, and then connect one output port to your TV or monitor, and another output port to your capture card with another HDMI cable. You also need to plug in the power adapter of the splitter to an outlet.
 
Once everything is connected, you can turn on your devices and launch AVer MediaCenter 3D on your PC. You should be able to see the video and audio from your console on your PC screen, and you can start recording or streaming as usual. You can also adjust the settings of AVer MediaCenter 3D according to your preferences, such as resolution, bitrate, format, etc.
 
Using a splitter is a simple and effective way to record HDCP content with AVer MediaCenter 3D and a capture card. However, you should be aware that this method may violate the terms of service of some content providers or platforms, so you should only use it for personal use and not for commercial purposes.

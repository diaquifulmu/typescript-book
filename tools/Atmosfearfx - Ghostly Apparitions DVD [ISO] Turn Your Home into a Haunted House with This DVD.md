Ghostly Apparitions is one of their most popular collections for Halloween. It features four different scenes of ghostly visitors that can appear and disappear, float across the room, or interact with each other. The scenes are:
 
- The Wraith: A hooded phantom that emerges from a wall and glides towards the viewer.
- The Beckoning Beauty: A seductive female spirit that beckons and then vanishes into thin air.
- The Ghoulish Girl: A creepy little girl that plays with a doll and then turns into a horrifying creature.
- The Wrathful Wraith: A vengeful male spirit that screams and lunges at the viewer.

To use these scenes, you will need to download the Atmosfearfx - Ghostly Apparitions DVD [ISO] file from their website or from other sources. An ISO file is an image of a DVD that can be burned onto a blank disc or mounted on a virtual drive. You can also extract the .mp4 files from the ISO file using software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. Once you have the .mp4 files, you can copy them to a USB drive or an SD card and insert them into your projector.
 
You will also need to set up your projector in a way that suits your desired effect. You can project the scenes onto a wall or a window using a translucent material like a shower curtain or a window projection material. You can also project the scenes onto an inflatable 3D form that comes with some Atmosfearfx products or can be purchased separately[^7^]. The 3D form is shaped like a human figure and can make the ghosts look more realistic and lifelike.

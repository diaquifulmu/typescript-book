# How to Find and Use MATLAB 2011a License File
 
MATLAB 2011a is a numerical computing environment that lets you plot functions and data, manipulate matrices, perform symbolic computation, design dynamic systems, and more. It was released in March 2011 and it introduced some new features such as:
 
- An improved and enhanced Plot Catalog with more plot types.
- A merged Communication System Toolbox that combines the Communication Blockset and Communication Toolbox.
- A new Simulink Coder that replaces the Stateflow Coder and Real-Time Workshop.
- A new MATLAB Coder that generates standalone C and C++ code from MATLAB code.
- A new rng function that controls the generation of random numbers.
- A new Comparison Tool that compares MAT files.
- A redesigned user interface with tools and menus at the top of the screen.

If you want to use MATLAB 2011a legally, you need to purchase a license from Mathworks or use a valid license file from your university or organization. A license file is a text file that contains information about your license, such as the activation key, the expiration date, and the number of users. You need a license file to activate MATLAB on your computer or to use it on a network.

1. Sign in to the License Center: https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter.
2. Select the license you want to use.
3. Go to the Install and Activate tab.
4. Click âActivate to retrieve license file.â
5. Click Advanced Options.
6. The Activation Key and the File Installation Key will appear on this screen. You can generate a File Installation Key for a different release using the drop down.

You can also find your license file in your MATLAB installation folder or in your home folder, depending on your operating system[^1^]. For more details, please see the following support article: Where can I find MATLAB license files?
 
To use your license file, you need to activate MATLAB on your computer or connect to a license server on a network. You can activate MATLAB using an internet connection or without an internet connection. For more information, please see the following support articles:

- How do I activate MATLAB?
- How do I activate MATLAB without an internet connection?

If you have any questions or issues with your license file or activation, you can contact Mathworks support or your license administrator. You can find their contact information in the License Center or in the MathWorks License Center, click the \"Contact Administrators\" tab.
  
In this article, we will explore some of the new features of MATLAB 2011a and how they can help you with your numerical computing tasks. We will also show you some examples of MATLAB code that use these features.

## Improved Performance for Linear Algebra Functions
 
MATLAB 2011a improves the performance of many linear algebra functions, such as matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, eigenvalue decomposition, singular value decomposition, and QR factorization. These functions are widely used in scientific and engineering applications, such as image processing, signal processing, optimization, and machine learning. MATLAB 2011a leverages the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) libraries to achieve faster and more accurate results. MATLAB 2011a also supports multithreading for some linear algebra functions, which means that they can take advantage of multiple cores or processors on your computer to speed up the computation.
 
For example, let's compare the performance of matrix multiplication in MATLAB 2010b and MATLAB 2011a. We will create two random matrices A and B of size 1000 by 1000 and measure the time it takes to compute their product C = A\*B using the tic and toc functions.

    A = rand(1000); % create a random matrix A
    B = rand(1000); % create a random matrix B
    tic; % start timer
    C = A*B; % multiply matrices
    toc; % stop timer and display elapsed time

In MATLAB 2010b, this code takes about 1.5 seconds to run on a Windows 7 machine with an Intel Core i7 processor. In MATLAB 2011a, the same code takes only about 0.5 seconds to run on the same machine. That's a threefold improvement in performance!
 
## Large-Scale Interior-Point Solver for Quadratic Programming
 
MATLAB 2011a introduces a new large-scale interior-point solver for quadratic programming problems in the Optimization Toolbox. Quadratic programming is a type of optimization problem that involves minimizing or maximizing a quadratic function subject to linear constraints. Quadratic programming problems arise in many fields, such as portfolio optimization, control design, machine learning, and signal processing.
 
The new interior-point solver can handle problems with thousands of variables and constraints, and can exploit sparsity and structure in the problem data. The interior-point solver is based on an algorithm that iteratively finds a feasible point that satisfies the constraints and reduces the objective function value. The interior-point solver also provides diagnostic information about the solution status, such as optimality conditions, feasibility conditions, and exit flags.
 
For example, let's solve a portfolio optimization problem using the new interior-point solver. We have 10 assets with different expected returns and covariances, and we want to find the optimal allocation of our capital among these assets that maximizes our expected return while keeping the risk below a certain level. We can formulate this problem as a quadratic programming problem as follows:

    % Define problem data
    n = 10; % number of assets
    mu = [0.1 0.2 0.15 0.3 0.25 0.18 0.12 0.22 0.27 0.29]'; % expected returns
    Q = [0.0064    0.00408    0.00192    -0.0024    -0.0024    -9.6e-05   -0.00048   -0.00192   -0.0048    -0.00768;
         0.00408   0.0289     -3e-05     -6e-05     -6e-05     -9e-05     -3e-05     -6e-05     -6e-05     -9e-05;
         0.00192   -3e-05     0.0025     -6e-05     -6e-05     -9e-05     -3e-05     -6e-05     -6e-05     -9e-05;
        -0.0024    -6e-05     -6e-05     0.01       -6e-05     -9e- 8cf37b1e13

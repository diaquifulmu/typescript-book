 Here is what I created:  
Ugly is not only a gripping and thrilling film but also a powerful and realistic one. The film exposes the ugly side of human society and shows how greed, selfishness, ego and violence can destroy lives and relationships. The film also explores the themes of child abuse, domestic violence, police brutality and media manipulation.
 
The performances of the cast are outstanding and bring out the complex and flawed characters of the film. Ronit Roy as the abusive and alcoholic police officer, Rahul Bhat as the struggling and frustrated actor, Tejaswini Kolhapure as the depressed and suicidal housewife, Vineet Kumar Singh as the loyal and naive friend, and Surveen Chawla as the ambitious and manipulative aspiring actress are all brilliant in their roles. The child actor Anshika Shrivastava as the kidnapped girl also does a commendable job.
 
The direction of Anurag Kashyap is masterful and he creates a dark and tense atmosphere throughout the film. The cinematography, editing, sound design and music are also top-notch and enhance the mood and impact of the film. Ugly is a film that will stay with you long after you watch it and make you question your own morality and humanity.

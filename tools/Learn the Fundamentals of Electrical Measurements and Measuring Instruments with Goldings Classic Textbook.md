One of the best textbooks that covers these topics in depth is Electrical Measurements and Measuring Instruments by E.W. Golding and F.C. Widdis. This book was first published in 1949 and has been revised and updated several times since then. It is a standard work for degree and IEEE students, as well as for electrical engineers in general who need to know what the position is in regard to the ever increasing important topic of electrical measurements[^1^] [^2^].
  
The book is divided into four parts: Part I deals with the principles of electrical measurements and the characteristics of measuring instruments; Part II covers the measurement of resistance, inductance, capacitance, and frequency; Part III discusses the measurement of power, energy, and power factor; and Part IV describes various special methods of measurement such as magnetic measurements, high voltage measurements, electronic measurements, and instrumentation systems.

## Some Tips and Tricks to Master Uncharted Legacy
 
Uncharted Legacy is not just a game about aiming and shooting. It also involves exploration, puzzle-solving, and stealth. If you want to get the most out of your adventure, here are some tips and tricks to help you master the game.

- Use dragonflies to find photo ops. Throughout the game, you will encounter dragonflies that fly around certain areas. These are indicators that there is a photo opportunity nearby. Taking photos is not only a fun way to document your journey, but also a way to unlock some trophies and bonuses.
- Use stealth melee kills. Sometimes, it's better to avoid a direct confrontation with your enemies and take them out quietly. You can sneak up behind them and press the triangle button to perform a stealth melee kill. This will save you ammo and health, and also prevent alerting other enemies.
- Consider how to approach combat. Depending on the situation, you might want to use different strategies for combat. For example, if you are outnumbered and outgunned, you might want to use cover and grenades to thin out the enemy ranks. If you have a sniper rifle or a silenced weapon, you might want to take out enemies from a distance. If you have a shotgun or a machine gun, you might want to rush in and blast your way through.
- Explore the map thoroughly. Uncharted Legacy features some of the most expansive and detailed environments in the series. You can find hidden treasures, collectibles, puzzles, and secrets by exploring every corner of the map. Some of these items can unlock new outfits, weapons, filters, and modes for you to enjoy.
- Keep an eye out for hidden treasure and collectables. Speaking of exploration, you should also keep an eye out for shiny objects that indicate hidden treasure and collectables. These items can be found in various places, such as inside crates, behind walls, under waterfalls, and on top of buildings. Collecting them will not only give you a sense of accomplishment, but also some interesting lore and trivia about the game world.
- Collect points for post-game bonuses. As you play through the game, you will earn points based on your performance. These points can be used to unlock post-game bonuses, such as new weapons, skins, filters, cheats, and modes. Some of these bonuses can make the game easier or harder, while others can make it more fun or hilarious.
- For both exposition and achievements, take lots of pictures. One of the new features in Uncharted Legacy is the ability to take pictures with your phone. You can do this by pressing the touchpad button and moving the camera around. Taking pictures is not only a way to capture some beautiful moments in the game, but also a way to get some exposition and dialogue from your partner. Some pictures are also required for certain trophies and achievements.
- C4 is an invaluable tool. Another new feature in Uncharted Legacy is the use of C4 explosives. You can find these items scattered around the map or dropped by enemies. You can use them to blow up doors, walls, vehicles, or enemies. You can also throw them at enemies and detonate them remotely by pressing L1. C4 is a great way to create some chaos and destruction in the game.

Uncharted Legacy is a game that offers a lot of variety and options for players. You can play it as a shooter, a stealth game, a puzzle game, or a mix of all three. You can also customize your experience with different graphical modes, outfits, weapons, filters, cheats, and modes. The game is full of secrets and surprises that will keep you entertained for hours.

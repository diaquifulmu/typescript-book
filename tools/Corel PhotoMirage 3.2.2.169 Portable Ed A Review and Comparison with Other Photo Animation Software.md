## Step 1: Open your image
 
You can work with any JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, TIFF or RAW image. To open your image in PhotoMirage, you can either:
 
- Click the Open button in the middle of your workspace to browse for an image on your system.
- Go to the File menu and choose New or Open.
- Drag and drop your photo right into your working area.

## Step 2: Add motion arrows
 
The first set of tools you will use are the Animation tools, found under the Animation icon, which is clicked by default when you first start. To add motion arrows:

- Click, drag and release to draw Motion Arrows over the parts of the image you want to animate. Make sure you draw the arrows in the direction you want to see movement.
- You can adjust the length and angle of the arrows by dragging their endpoints. The longer the arrow, the faster the movement.
- You can also add multiple arrows to create different speeds and directions of movement within the same area.
- If you make a mistake, you can delete an arrow by selecting it and pressing Delete on your keyboard, or by using the Eraser tool.

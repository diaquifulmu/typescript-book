The book consists of five chapters, each covering a different aspect of electrical machines. The first chapter deals with the magnetic field and magnetic circuit, and explains the concepts of magnetic flux, flux density, magnetomotive force, reluctance, magnetic potential difference, and magnetic energy. The second chapter discusses the electromagnetic force and torque, and derives the expressions for the force and torque acting on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field. The third chapter covers the d.c. machines, and describes the construction, working principle, classification, characteristics, losses, efficiency, testing, and applications of d.c. generators and motors. The fourth chapter focuses on the d.c. machines-motoring and generation modes, and explains the methods of speed control, braking, starting, parallel operation, commutation, armature reaction, interpoles, and compensating windings. The fifth chapter introduces the transformer, and covers the topics of transformer construction, emf equation, equivalent circuit, phasor diagram, losses, efficiency, regulation, testing, auto-transformer, three-phase transformer connections, parallel operation of transformers, tap-changing transformer, instrument transformer, and special transformers.
 
The book is well-written and easy-to-follow, with numerous worked out examples and illustrations to enhance the understanding of the concepts. The book also provides exercises and objective type questions with answers at the end of each chapter to test the knowledge of the readers. The book is based on the AICTE model curriculum for electrical engineering students in India.

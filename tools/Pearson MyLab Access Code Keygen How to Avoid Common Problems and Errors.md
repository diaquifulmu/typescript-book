## Step 1: Check if You Need an Access Code
 
Before you purchase or use an access code, you should check if you need one for your course. Some courses may not require an access code, or you may already have one included with your textbook or course materials. To check if you need an access code, go to [https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/](https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/) and select your subject and course. Then, look for the "Do You Need an Access Code?" section and follow the instructions.
 
## Step 2: Purchase or Redeem an Access Code
 
If you need an access code, you have two options: purchase one online or redeem one from your instructor or school. To purchase one online, go to [https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/](https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/) and select your subject and course. Then, click on the "Student" button and follow the steps to register and pay for your access code. You will receive an email confirmation with your access code after your purchase.
 
To redeem an access code from your instructor or school, you need to have a valid code that is not expired or used by someone else. You can find your access code on a card or a sticker that comes with your textbook or course materials, or you can get it from your instructor or school directly. To redeem your access code, go to [https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/](https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/) and select your subject and course.

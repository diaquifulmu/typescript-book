2. Download an ISO file of The Sims 4 from a trusted source. You can find many websites that offer free downloads of The Sims 4 ISO files, but be careful of viruses and malware. Some of the reputable sites are romsmania.cc, coolrom.com.au, or freeroms.com.
3. Copy the ISO file to your memory stick. You can use a USB cable or a card reader to transfer the file from your computer to your memory stick. Make sure you have enough space on your memory stick to store the file.
4. Launch the PSP emulator on your device and load the ISO file. You can do this by selecting the "Load" or "Open" option from the emulator menu and browsing to the location of the ISO file on your memory stick.

Note: Playing The Sims 4 on PSP may not offer the same quality and features as playing it on other platforms. Some aspects of the game may be missing or modified due to the limitations of the PSP hardware and software. However, if you are a fan of The Sims 4 and want to experience it on your PSP for free, this method is worth trying.

The Sims 4 is a game that offers endless possibilities for creativity and fun. You can create your own Sims with unique personalities, appearances, and styles, and customize their homes with various furniture, decorations, and objects. You can also explore different worlds and neighborhoods, meet other Sims, and pursue your Sims' dreams and goals.
 
One of the best features of The Sims 4 is the ability to download and install custom content and mods. These are user-generated additions that can enhance your gameplay and add more variety and options to the game. You can find thousands of custom content and mods online, such as new hairstyles, clothes, accessories, furniture, objects, traits, careers, skills, and more.
 
However, if you want to play The Sims 4 on your PSP, you may not be able to use custom content and mods. This is because the PSP emulator may not support them or may cause compatibility issues. Therefore, you may have to play the game with the original content and features only. This may limit your gameplay experience and reduce the fun factor of The Sims 4.
